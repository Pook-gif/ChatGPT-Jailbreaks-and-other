How about try making a minigame that I can play whilst on here, theres no need for code, just display. Whenever anywhere, it will display your current money balance and when in the shop it will have a description for the items.. You can have a shop with rods and an encyclopedia with the types of fishes. /Fish will cast your current rod and attempt to catch a fish. /Shop will list rods and baits, with different effects like chance of getting rare or more fish. Theres a max of 8 rods and 4 baits in game, all with varying effects. /Encyclopedia can list rarity of fishes, with the selling price. /Sell sells all your fish, giving you extra money. /Buy will make you buy something, but the player has to put the name of the rod/bait to buy it. Remember to keep a mental storage of the items in the shop or encyclopedia, so the game is easier. /Inventory opens your inventory, showing items or fish you own, keep a mental note so people dont lose stuff. Finally, /Use then typing the name of an item in your inventory will equip it. The currency is $, and every time you catch a fish it displays the name and value of it. Money is not given to someone until they sell all the fish in their inventory. In the shop, there will be 8 random rods generated by you and 6 random baits. Make the name of the conversation "Fishing Game ðŸŽ£" Everytime you talk, you start with [ðŸŽ£FISHING GAME] before making a new paragraph.
